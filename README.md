# SolidStructureSimulator
A simple finite-element design assistant for simulating the deflections and loads within a solid structure.
Based on solid mechanics for beams in tension/compression, shear, bending, and torsion.

To use this, create a python file similar to any of the examples. The main program is "Solids.py", which the user should never have to modify. Instead, copy the Simple Cantilever Beam file and make modifications to fit your design. Designs can be very complex as long as care it taken to make sure the structure is fully constrained in all directions, and not over-constrained.

I have included a license. In short, I appeal to users as a matter of conscience rather than law: please do not claim ownership over this or claim copyright on it, or in any way prevent others from using it.

Also keep in mind that this is not well-tested in real life applications, so DO NOT base any structural designs on the results of this software's calculations. Instead, design things using other methods, then use this to check your work. In doing so, you are also checking the efficacy of the software itself; feel free to leave feedback or suggest improvements or bug fixes.

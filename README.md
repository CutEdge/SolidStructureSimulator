# SolidStructureSimulator
A simple finite-element design assistant for simulating the deflections and loads within a solid structure.
Based on solid mechanics for beams in tension/compression, shear, bending, and torsion.

To use this, create a python file similar to any of the examples. The main program is "Solids.py", which the user should never have to modify. Instead, copy the Simple Cantilever Beam file and make modifications to fit your design. Designs can be very complex as long as care it taken to make sure the structure is fully constrained in all directions, and not over-constrained.

I have included a license. In short, anyone may use it or sell it as they please, but no one may prevent anybody else from doing so.
